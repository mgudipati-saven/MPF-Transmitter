=When reset packet is not acknowledged.
=Heartbeat when window size is zero.

[TestCases]
	[1.Ack]
	1.1=Start a 10 sec timeout after sending 7 packets including type 2 and heartbeat
	1.2=When an Ack is received:
	  1.2, clear the 10 sec timeout
	  1.3, transmit new packets, if any
	1.4=When Ack timeout:
	  1.4, retransmit, start the 10 sec timer again.
	  1.5, reset seqno if num retransmissions exceeds a certain limit
	
	[2.Nak]
	2.1=When a Nak is received:
	  2.1, clear the 10 sec timeout
	  2.2, retransmit packets with seqno >= nak seqno
	  2.3, transmit new packets, if any
	  2.4, increment the nak count
	  2.5, if nak count is > 5, send reset seqno
	  
	[3.Heartbeat]
	3.1=Send heartbeat every 60 secs
	3.2=When in reset:
	  3.2, skip heartbeat
	
	[4.Type 2 Packet]
	4.1=Send type 2 packet if the data for the required transactions or tokens is available
	
	[5.Reset]
	5.1=When a reset is sent:
	  5.1, stop further publishing
	  5.2, wait for ack for further publishing
	  5.3, new transmissions sent with seqno starting from 33
	
	[6.SeqNo]
	6.1=Starts from 33
	6.2=Wraps around after 127
	
	[7.MPF Connection]
	7.1=Connect to mpf feed on the given host:port
	7.2=Reconnect:
	  7.2, when disconnected, attempt to reconnect
	  7.3, reset seqno
